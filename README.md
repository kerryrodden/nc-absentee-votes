# North Carolina Absentee Votes

Aggregated data on absentee (mail) ballots from the November 2020 election in North Carolina. 

The original data is from the [North Carolina State Board of Elections](https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data/absentee-data) and is updated daily; this repo contains a custom aggregation of the data that is created via a Github Action.

Fields in the custom aggregation are: county name, race, ethnicity, ballot request party, and ballot return status. This makes it possible to analyze whether ballots are being accepted at different rates across groups.
